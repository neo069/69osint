# 👋 Hey there!

I'm **Neo** — a curious mind with a growing passion for **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)**.  
I'm new to the scene, but I’m all in — learning, exploring, and building tools or techniques that can help uncover digital clues from public sources.

- 📚 Learning something new every day — and sharing as I go!
